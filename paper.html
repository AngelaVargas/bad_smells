    <h2> Bad Smells Analysis </h2>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <p>
      In computer programming, a <i>bad smell</i> (or <i>code smell</i>) is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. Suryanarayana et al. define bad smells as quote;certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality&quote; (Suryanarayana, 2014).
    </p>
    <p>The bad smells that we can identify currently are:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Duplicate scripts</b>: Code is copy and pasted, sometimes with minor changes. Hinders the use of user-defined blocks and as such can be seen a limitation to the development of the abstraction skill.</li>
        <li><b>Default names</b>: Objects are not given a meaningful name, but keep the default <i>SpriteN</i> name. It hinders interaction among objects, as using them in other objects becomes more difficult.</li>
        <li><b>Backdrop Naming</b>: Scenarios are not given a meaningful name, but keep the default <i>BackdropN</i> name. It hinders the use of several scenarios to reference them.</li>
        <li><b>Dead code</b>: Code that is never being executed (usually because they do not have a starting condition). It may indicate missing functionality.</li>
        <li><b>Attribute initialization</b>: Variables are not well initialized. It hinders the start of some objects, because their position, size, costume, etc are not correctly initialized.</li>

      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The effect ot bad smells in the analyzed projects is very important. More than 97% of the projects (considering all snapshots) have at least one bad smell. Of the small fraction of projects without bad smells, most have low scores of mastery (55.9% of them have 0 points).

      2. The most frequent bad smell is 'AttributeInitialization', followed by 'Sprite_names'. That is, badly
      initialized variables and default names.

      3. The most frequent values for each bad smell are low. There are projects with more than 10 duplicated scripts,
      for example, but the 10 most frequent values are below.

      4. Taking into account the percentage of each profile, projects with advanced level
      present a very similar average in bad habits.
